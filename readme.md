# Jest

The world of Jest is a highly complicated structure, running inside a computer, a mere simulation written by the hacker that goes by the pseudoname Plagymaes. He wrote code for an infinite, self-updating world that can combine numbers in strange ways to generate newer numbers, in any formula that he likes. Most recently, he repuposed The Jest System into a crypto-mining platform, where all processes merge numbers into larger numbers making him money.

## The Jest System

The Jest system runs inside a computer, it is a mere simulation, nothing more than a program, reducible to a string of strange symbols. However, Plagymaes organised this chaotic world into some geography to keep himself sane.

### Blocks

The largest entity of the Jest System is the Block. A block is basically a file on the system that generates certain output. A Block is composed of many Directories, and each Directory can have many Hex-Codes (hC) or Processes sitting inside them. Directories have neighbour Dicrectories that can be traversed to. 

### Directories

A Directory is the building block of the Jest System. Essentially the entire Jest System is a ever growing and shinking, self adjusting set of Directories that have been campartmentalised into Blocks. Every Directory has an index within a block and some directories may have names if they are important enough.

#### Special Directories

Some Directories are special to every block.

1) The MetaData Directory: Every Block has a MetaData Directory, it contains useful information about the Block itself, such as the number of Directories inside it, its purpose and so on.

2) The Output Directory: Every Block has an Output Directory, this is where every block places its information once it is done processing.

### Hex-Codes (hC)

A Hex-Code is simply a two letter string in the Hexadecimal Base meaning, it can contain one of the following digits (0123456789abcdef) but twice. "0f" is a valid hC but "0x" is not. Hex-Codes are the tools of a programmer, they are needed to make items and powers within the Jest System. For Example, if you do not have certain "Permission Badges" which are basically Hex-Codes that certify that heir holder is permitted to access certain Directories, The Jest System will deploy its police network to hunt you for violation of protocol.

#### Important Hex-Code Types

##### Permission Badges
They are Hex-Codes that permit you to access restricted Directories.The Output and the MetaData Directory are resitricted Directories in every Block, you need specia badges to access them without breaking protocol.

### Processes

Everybody is a process in the Jest System. Every process is allotted finite memory to hold a fixed number of Hex-Codes, and every proces has a purpose. They are the NPCs of Jest. You can interact with them through standard protocol. Every Process has a global ID, and it is recognised by the Jest system through that ID.

## Process ID 66

The Jest is a chaotic self-adjusting system. It randomly puts numbers together to see what works and discards methods that don't give results. It creates processes within itself to manage each task and the sole purpose of the process is to complete that task. After the task is done, the process is no longer required and is terminated. However what Plagymaes did not forsee was that his system might be complicated enough to encode free will.
